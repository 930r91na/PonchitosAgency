# Travel Agency Ponchito Booking System 

This repository hosts the code for an automated booking system for the Travel Agency Ponchito. The project aims to digitalize the agency's reservation activities using a relational database management system. 

## Overview

The application uses an automated menu, where potential trips can be viewed, simulated, and booked. The database is composed of relations that group all necessary information for a trip. 

The application provides functionalities to:

1. Consult the database.
2. Modify existing records.
3. Add new information.
4. Register new customers.
5. Authorize a travel simulation after validation.

Feel free to explore the repository, contribute, or use it as a template for a similar project.
